long_description="""pyCOLA is a multithreaded Python/Cython N-body code, 
implementing the Comoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method in the 
temporal and spatial domains. 

pyCOLA is based on the following two papers:
(todo)
...
...
please, cite them if using for scientific research.

pyCOLA requires `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>_`, `SciPy 
<http://www.scipy.org/>`_, `pyFFTW 
<https://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/index.html>`_, `h5py 
<http://www.h5py.org/>`_. Note that pyFFTW v0.9.2 does not support 
large arrays, so one needs to install the development version from 
`github <https://github.com/hgomersall/pyFFTW>`_, where the bug has 
been fixed.

The pyCOLA documentation can be found 
`here <https://bitbucket.org/tassev/pycola/downloads/pyCOLA.pdf>`_, and the source
is on `bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/tassev/pycola>`_.
